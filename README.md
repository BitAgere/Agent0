# Agent0
Agent0 is an agent-oriented programming language based on the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model, where agents are programmed with mental attitudes of beliefs, desires, and intentions to drive their autonomous actions.

# Agent-Oriented Programming (AOP)

Agent0 describes a new computational framework called **agent-oriented programming (AOP)**. Let's break down the key concepts:

## 1. Agent-Oriented Programming (AOP)

AOP is a specialized form of object-oriented programming. In object-oriented programming, you have "objects" with data and methods. AOP takes this further by creating "agents" which are more autonomous and have a "mental state".

## 2. Mental State

Agents in AOP have a mental state that includes:

*   **Beliefs:** What the agent believes to be true about the world.
*   **Decisions(Desire):** Choices the agent has made.
*   **Capabilities:** Actions the agent can perform.
*   **Obligations(Intentions):** Commitments the agent has made.

## 3. Formal Description

*   The mental state of agents is formally described using an extension of epistemic logic (logic of knowledge and belief).
*   This extension includes ways to represent time and operators for obligations, decisions, and capabilities.

## 4. Agent Programs

*   Agents are controlled by programs that include primitives (basic instructions) for communication.

## 5. Communication and Speech Act Theory

*   Communication primitives are inspired by speech act theory, meaning they are classified by the type of action they perform (informing, requesting, offering, etc.).

## 6. Agent Interpreters

*   Agent interpreters are likely programs that execute agent programs and manage their interactions.

## In Summary

AOP introduces a new way of programming where the programs are more like independent agents with their own beliefs, goals, and ways of interacting with each other.
This framework has potential applications in artificial intelligence, multi-agent systems, and other areas where autonomous behavior (Like Crypto: Bitcoin) is desired.
