# Agent0
Agent0 is an agent-oriented programming language based on the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model, where agents are programmed with mental attitudes of beliefs, desires, and intentions to drive their autonomous actions.

# Agent-Oriented Programming (AOP)

Agent0 describes a new computational framework called **agent-oriented programming (AOP)**. Let's break down the key concepts:

## 1. Agent-Oriented Programming (AOP)

AOP is a specialized form of object-oriented programming. In object-oriented programming, you have "objects" with data and methods. AOP takes this further by creating "agents" which are more autonomous and have a "mental state".

## 2. Mental State

Agents in AOP have a mental state that includes:

*   **Beliefs:** What the agent believes to be true about the world.
*   **Decisions(Desire):** Choices the agent has made.
*   **Capabilities:** Actions the agent can perform.
*   **Obligations(Intentions):** Commitments the agent has made.

## 3. Formal Description

*   The mental state of agents is formally described using an extension of epistemic logic (logic of knowledge and belief).
*   This extension includes ways to represent time and operators for obligations, decisions, and capabilities.

## 4. Agent Programs

*   Agents are controlled by programs that include primitives (basic instructions) for communication.

## 5. Communication and Speech Act Theory

*   Communication primitives are inspired by speech act theory, meaning they are classified by the type of action they perform (informing, requesting, offering, etc.).

## 6. Agent Interpreters

*   Agent interpreters are likely programs that execute agent programs and manage their interactions.

## In Summary

AOP introduces a new way of programming where the programs are more like independent agents with their own beliefs, goals, and ways of interacting with each other.
This framework has potential applications in artificial intelligence, multi-agent systems, and other areas where autonomous behavior (Like Crypto: Bitcoin) is desired.

# Agent0: A Self-Bootstrapping AOP Language on the BitAgere Platform

**üöÄ Big News!** I'm introducing a revolutionary Agent-Oriented Programming (AOP) language on the BitAgere platform - **Agent0!**

**ü§ñ Agent0 is capable of bootstrapping, automatically evolving, and perfecting its own code!** ü§Ø

**‚ú® Agent0's Powerful Capabilities:**

* **Self-Iteration:** Analyzes its own code, improves algorithms, and enhances efficiency.
* **Syntax Evolution:** Adapts and expands its syntax based on needs and environmental changes.
* **Functionality Enhancement:** Perfects AOP functionality, including improving agent communication, collaboration, and learning abilities.

**üí™ BitAgere Platform Provides Robust Support for Agent0's Evolution:**

* **Agere System:** Serves as the foundational framework for Agent0's interaction with other AI systems, like ChatGPT Adapter and Bitcoin Mechanical Currency AI.
* **Global Adaptability:** Dynamically adjusts resource allocation and optimizes communication efficiency to support Agent0's evolutionary process.

**‚ú® Users Can Easily Build Custom Agere Systems with Agent0:**

* Simply call the Adaptive Bitcoin Mechanical Currency payment interface to communicate with Agent0 Agere and ChatGPT Adaptive Agere.
* The BitAgere platform automatically customizes Agere systems based on user needs, without any manual intervention!

**üí° Project Goal:**

This is a personal project I'm very excited about. My goal is to build a self-bootstrapping (adaptive + self-evolving) AOP language, Agent0, based on the BitAgere system.

**üöÄ Agent0's Disruptive Innovation:**

* **No Programming Experience Required:** Users can utilize Agent0 without any prior programming skills.
* **No Operations Required:** The BitAgere platform handles the execution and maintenance of Agent0 code, freeing users from any operational tasks.
* **Attention-Driven:** Users simply need to clearly express their desired business needs (beliefs + goals) using attention, and Agent0 will automatically generate the corresponding code and complete all business processes.

**üéØ Agent0's Application Scenarios:**

* **Automated Business Processes:** Agent0 can automate various business processes such as order processing, customer service, and data analysis.
* **Personalized Customization:** Users can customize Agent0's behavior based on their needs, such as setting different goals, preferences, and rules.
* **Decentralized Collaboration:** Agent0 can collaborate with other agents to accomplish complex tasks.

**ü§ù Join us in building a decentralized, automated, and self-evolving AI ecosystem!**
